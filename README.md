# 3-D-Deep-Learning-for-Point-Cloud-Segmentation-Classification
It is the entire code for training and testing the ContiNet architecture on ModelNet40, and S3DIS dataset for classification and segmentation of point cloud data respectively.
Windows-based and GPU-enabled code.
ModelNet dataset can be downloaded from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/modelnet40-princeton-3d-object-dataset)
The Python script is also added to convert the mesh file (.off format) file to point cloud data (.npy format) 

The S3DIS dataset can be downloaded from this link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDimvNMCGhy_rmBA2gHfDu3naktRm6A8BPwAWWDv-Uhm6Shw/viewform?c=0&w=1)

Data visualizer is also added to visualize the data

Impimented using Python 3.11.8
